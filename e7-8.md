The read function will change its Sales_data parameter and pass the information back via plain reference.

The print function won't change its Sales_data parameter, and by using a reference to const, we can print const Sales_data object as well.



Define read's Sales_data parameter as plain reference since it's intended to change the revenue's value.

Define print's Sales_data parameter as a reference to const since it isn't intended to change any member's value of this object.
