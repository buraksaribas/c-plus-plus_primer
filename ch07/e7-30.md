Pros

    more explicit

    less scope for misreading

    can use the member function parameter which name is same as the member name.

      void setAddr(const std::string &addr) { this->addr = addr; }

Cons

    more to read

    sometimes redundant

      std::string getAddr() const { return this->addr; } // unnecessary





Pros:

    It is much more clear by using this to refer members.
    The parameters in member function can have the same name as the data members if we use this pointer to refer data members.

Cons:

    The code will look redundant.
