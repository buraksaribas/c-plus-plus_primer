    What is a static class member?

A class member that is associated with the class, rather than with individual objects of the class type.

    What are the advantages of static members?

each object can no need to store a common data. And if the data is changed, each object can use the new value.

    How do they differ from ordinary members?

    a static data member can have incomplete type.
    we can use a static member as a default argument.





A static class member is a member that is associated with the class, rather than with individual objects of the class type. It exists outside any object of the class.

Advantages:

    Storage efficient.
    If a static member of a class changes, each object of the class will use the new value of that static member.
    A static data member can have incomplete type.
    A static member (either a data member or a member function) can be used as a default argument.

Differences between ordinary members and static members:

    A static member belongs to the class, an ordinary member belongs to objects of the class.
