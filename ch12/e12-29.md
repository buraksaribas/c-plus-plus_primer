We could have written the loop to manage the interaction with the user as a do while (5.4.4, p. 189) loop. Rewrite the loop to use a do while. Explain which version you prefer and why.

do {
    std::cout << "enter word to look for, or q to quit: ";
    string s;
    if (!(std::cin >> s) || s == "q") break;
    print(std::cout, tq.query(s)) << std::endl;
} while ( true );
I prefer do while, because it looks clearer.
