Explain what happens in the following code:

int *q = new int(42), *r = new int(100);
r = q;
auto q2 = make_shared<int>(42), r2 = make_shared<int>(100);
r2 = q2;

to q and r:
Memory leakage happens. Because after r = q was executed, no pointer points to the int r had pointed to. It implies that no chance to free the memory for it.

to q2 and r2:
It's safe. Because after 'r2 = q2', the reference count belongs to r2 reduce to 0 and the reference count belongs to q2 increase to 2, then the memory allocated by r2 will be released automatically.
