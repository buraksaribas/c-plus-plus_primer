Does this class need const versions of push_back and pop_back? If so, add them. If not, why arenâ€™t they needed?

You can certainly do this if you want to, but there doesn't seem to be any logical reason. The compiler doesn't complain because this doesn't modify data (which is a pointer) but rather the thing data points to, which is perfectly legal to do with a const pointer. by David Schwartz.
