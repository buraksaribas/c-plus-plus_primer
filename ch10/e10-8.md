We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers over which they operate. Why doesnâ€™t the use of back_inserter invalidate this claim?

Because all the changes of the container size are made by the insert iterator, not the algorithm.

The algorithms may

    read elements,
    wirte elements (change the elements in the container),
    reorder elements (change the sequence of the elements in the container),

and the algorithms never

    add/remove elements (change the size of the container).



Inserters like back_inserter is part of <iterator> rather than <algorithm>.
