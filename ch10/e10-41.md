    Based only on the algorithm and argument names, describe the operation that the each of the following library algorithms performs:

replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val); // replace the old_elements in the input range as new_elements.
replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val); // replace the elements in the input range which pred is true as new_elements.
replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val); // copy the new_elements which is old_elements in the input range into dest.
replace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val); // copy the new_elements which pred is true in the input range into dest.
