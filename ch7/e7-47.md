Whether the conversion of a string to Sales_data is desired depends on how we think our users will use the conversion. In this case, it might be okay. The string in null_book probably represents a nonexistent ISBN.

Benefits:

    prevent the use of a constructor in a context that requires an implicit conversion
    we can define a constructor which is used only with the direct form of initialization

Drawbacks:

    meaningful only on constructors that can be called with a single argument





It should be explicit. Otherwise, code like item.combine("9-999-99999-9") will compile, but the code has no logical meaning.

Making the constructor explicit will stop compiler from automatically converting one type to the class type, which makes the code same as anticipation.

The drawback is we must call the constructor explicitly if we want to cover one type to the class type.
