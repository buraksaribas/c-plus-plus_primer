If the program reads 256 words, the capacity is 1024.

If the program reads 512 words, the capacity is 1024.

If the program reads 1000 words, the capacity is 1024.

If the program reads 1048 words, the capacity is at least 1048.




    If the program in the previous exercise reads 256 words, what is its likely capacity after it is resized? What if it reads 512? 1, 000? 1, 048?
