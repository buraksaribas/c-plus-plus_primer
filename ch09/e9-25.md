    In the program on page 349 that erased a range of elements, what happens if elem1 and elem2 are equal? What if elem2 or both elem1 and elem2 are the off-the-end iterator?

if elem1 and elem2 are equal, nothing happened.

if elem2 is the off-the-end iterator, it would delete from elem1 to the end.

if both elem1 and elem2 are the off-the-end iterator, nothing happened too.





If elem1 and elem2 are equal, then no element will be removed from the container.

If elem2 or both elem1 and elem2 are the off-the-end iterator, then all elements from elem1 to the last element in the container will be removed.
