    What is wrong with the following program? How might you correct it?

list<int> lst1;
list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(), iter2 = lst1.end();
while (iter1 < iter2)

Fixed:

while(iter1 != iter2)

note:

operator < is not implemented in std::list, because std::list is essetially a doubly linked list. Addresses of nodes of linked list are not necessarily continuous.
