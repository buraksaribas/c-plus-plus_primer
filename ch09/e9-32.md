In the program on page 354 would it be legal to write the call to insert as follows?
//          If not, why not?
//          iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter++);
//  @Answer the statement is illegal, because as said in Standard [5.2.2] :
//          "The order of evaluation of arguments is unspecified."
//          As a result, after entering function insert,
//          iter could be its original value or original value + 1 or even anything else,
//          depending on how compiler implemented.



It is not legal. The order of evaluation of the arguments in function insert is undefined, so that if the second argument is evalated first, then the program logic will be wrong.
