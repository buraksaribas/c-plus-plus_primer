    Explain how the loop from page 345 that used the return from insert to add elements to a list would work if we inserted into a vector instead.

It's the same.

    The first call to insert takes the string we just read and puts it in front of the element denoted by iter. The value returned by insert is an iterator referring to this new element. We assign that iterator to iter and repeat the while, reading another word. As long as there are words to insert, each trip through the while inserts a new element ahead of iter and reassigns to iter the location of the newly inserted element. That element is the (new) first element. Thus, each iteration inserts an element ahead of the first element in the vector.



The member function insert(p, t) has the same effect on both list and vector containers, but the cost is different. Inserting an element into list is cheap, while inserting an element into vector will cause all the elements after the newly inserted element be moved. Thus every time the while loop body is excuted, all elements in the vector are moved backward, and new element is inserted in the front of the vector.
