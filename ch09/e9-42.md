    Given that you want to read a character at a time into a string, and you know that you need to read at least 100 characters, how might you improve the performance of your program?

Use member reserve(120) to allocate enough space for this string. (@Mooophy)



We can call s.reserve(100) to preallocate the space for the string s.
