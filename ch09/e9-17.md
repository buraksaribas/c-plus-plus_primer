    Assuming c1 and c2 are containers, what (if any) constraints does the following usage place on the types of c1 and c2?

First, there must be the identical container and same type holded. Second, the type held must support relational operation. (@Mooophy)

Both c1 and c2 are the containers except the unordered associative containers.(@pezy)




The constraints are:

    the lefthand and righthand operands must have the same container type and element type.
    the element of the container must support the < operator.
