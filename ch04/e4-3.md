I think that is an acceptable trade-off. When an expression refers to and change the same object, we can always seperate that expression into several expressions to avoid the situation except where:

    The operator involved is one of and &&, or ||, conditional ?:, comma , operator,
    The subexpression that change the operand is itself the operand of another subexpression.
