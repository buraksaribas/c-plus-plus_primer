For example, the function arrPtr in [Exercise 6.38](# Exercise-638) and make_plural in [Exercise 6.42](# Exercise-642) should be defined as inline. But the function func in [Exercise 6.4](# Exercise-64) shouldn't. It is not that small and it's only being called once. Hence, it will probably not expand as inline.
