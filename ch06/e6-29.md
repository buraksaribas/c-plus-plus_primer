Yes, I would use a reference as the loop control variable. So that we don't need to copy the value from the initializer_list.


Depends on the type of elements of initializer_list. When the type is PODType, reference is unnecessary. Because POD is cheap to copy(such as int). Otherwise, Using reference(const) is the better choice.
