A candidate function is a function with the same name as the called function and for which a declaration is visible at the point of the call.

A viable function is a candidate function with the same number of parameters as there are arguments in the call, and the type of each argument must match or be convertible to the type of its corresponding parameter.


candidate function:

    Set of functions that are considered when resolving a function call. (all the functions with the name used in the call for which a declaration is in scope at the time of the call.)

viable function:

    Subset of the candidate functions that could match a given call. It have the same number of parameters as arguments to the call, and each argument type can be converted to the corresponding parameter type.
