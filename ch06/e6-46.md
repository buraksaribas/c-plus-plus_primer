No, a constexpr function may only contains statements that generate no actions at run time, but the member method size() must be called at run time, thus the function can not be a constexpr function.



No.

Because std::string::size() is not a constexpr function and s1.size() == s2.size() is not a constant expression.

    For a non-template, non-defaulted constexpr function or a non-template, non-defaulted, non-inheriting constexpr constructor, if no argument values exist such that an invocation of the function or constructor could be an evaluated subexpression of a core constant expression (5.19), the program is ill-formed; no diagnostic required.
