The loop are used to keep reading string from the input until sought found. It is a bad idea to use assert check whether cin is in an error state. Because when the program compiled with NDEBUG preprocessor variable, the statement would not be excuted.




This loop let user input a word all the way until the word is sought.

It isn't a good use of assert. because if user begin to input a word, the cin would be always have content. so the assert would be always true. It is meaningless. using assert(s == sought) is better.
