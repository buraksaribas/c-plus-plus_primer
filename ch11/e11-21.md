Assuming word_count is a map from string to size_t and word is a string, explain the following loop:

while (cin >> word)
    ++word_count.insert({ word, 0 }).first->second;
This code can be explained like this pseudocode:

while reading into word
    if word_count has key word:
        word_count[word] += 1
    else:
        word_count[word] = 0
        word_count[word] += 1
