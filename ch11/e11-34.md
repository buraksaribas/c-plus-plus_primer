What would happen if we used the subscript operator instead of find in the transform function?

Say the code has been changed like below:

const string& transform(const string &s, const map<string, string> &m)
{
    return m[s];
}
The above code won't compile because the subscript operator might insert an element (when the element with the key s is not found), and we may use subscript only on a map that is not const.
