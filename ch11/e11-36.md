Our program does no checking on the validity of either input file. In particular, it assumes that the rules in the transformation file are all sensible. What would happen if a line in that file has a key, one space, and then the end of the line? Predict the behavior and then check it against your version of the program.

If so, a key-value pair will be {key, " "}(" ".size() !> 1), which cannot be added into the map. As a result, the key would not be replaced with any string.
