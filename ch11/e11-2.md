    Give an example of when each of list, vector, deque, map, and set might be most useful.

    list : anytime when a doubly-linked list is required.
    vector : anytime when a dynamic array is required.
    deque : An answer from SO.
    map : dictionary.
    set : when to keep elements sorted and unique.




A list may be used when we need to insert/delete at the middle frequently, such as a linked list.

A vector may be used when we need random-access, such as a dynamic normal array.

A deque may be used like a queue.

A map may be used like a dictionary.

A set may be used to check whether a value is present.
