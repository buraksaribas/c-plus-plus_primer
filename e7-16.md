There are no restrictions on how often an access specifier may appear.The specified access level remains in effect until the next access specifier or the end of the class body.

The members which are accessible to all parts of the program should define after a public specifier.

The members which are accessible to the member functions of the class but are not accessible to code that uses the class should define after a private specifier.




There is no constraint on where and how often an access specifier may appear inside a class definition. A class may contain zero or more access specifiers, each kind of access specifiers can appears multiple times. There is no constraint on the sequence of access specifiers too.

The constructors and member functions that are part of the interface should be defined after a public specifier.

The data members and member functions that are part of the implementation should be defined after a private specifier.
