    What is a copy-assignment operator? When is this operator used? What does the synthesized copy-assignment operator do? When is it synthesized?

The copy-assignment operator is function named operator= and takes an argument of the same type as the class.

This operator is used when assignment occurred.

The synthesized copy-assignment operator assigns each nonstatic member of the right-hand object to corresponding member of the left-hand object using the copy-assignment operator for the type of that member.

It is synthesized when the class does not define its own.

The compiler synthesizes a copy-assignment operator if the class does not define its own.
