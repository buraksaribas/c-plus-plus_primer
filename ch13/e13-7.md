    What happens when we assign one StrBlob to another? What about StrBlobPtrs?

In both cases, shallow copy will happen. All pointers point to the same address. The use_count changed the same as 13.3.





When we assign one StrBlob to another, the underlying smart pointer is copyed. But the vector to which the pointer pointed is not copyed, which means both StrBlob objects will use the same vector. This may not be what we want.

When we assign one StrBlobPtr to another, the same thing happens as assigning a StrBlob, but this may be what we want.
