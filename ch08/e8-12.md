    Why didnâ€™t we use in-class initializers in PersonInfo?

Cause we need a aggregate class here. so it should have no in-class initializers.



Because the synthesised default constructor will be called when an object of class PersonInfo is created, which will default initialized its data members. Meanwhile, both string and vector have default constructors, and will be used when default initialized. Thus, we don't need in-class initializers to initialze data members in PersonInfo.
