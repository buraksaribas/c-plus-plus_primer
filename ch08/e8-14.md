    Why did we declare entry and nums as const auto &?

    cause they are all class type, not the built-in type. so reference more effective.
    output shouldn't change their values. so we added the const.





By using reference, we avoid copy every object in vectors. By using const, we avoid accidentally changing the values of elements in vectors.
