The condition of a stream is equivalent to !fail(), which means set either failbit or badbit will terminate the loop. For example, errors list below will terminate the loop:

    System-level failure. (Set the badbit) Such as an unrecoverable r/w error.
    Recoverable error. (Set the failbit) Such as reading a character when numeric data expected.
    Reaching end-of-file. (Set both the eofbit and failbit)




    What causes the following while to terminate?

while (cin >> i) /*  ...    */

putting cin in an error state cause to terminate. such as eofbit, failbit and badbit.
